IIFE - Immediately invoked function expression --> In this we can see that an anonymous funciton is declared and because it has to be executed and without a name is difficult we tend to exectute the funciton immediately after it has been declared by putting them in parenthesis.

(function ()
{
var a=10;
var b=10;
console.log(a+b);
}) ();```
